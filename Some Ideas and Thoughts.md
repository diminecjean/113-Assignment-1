# Space for ideas
*note: just ideas, not necessary need to implement*

For the student desasiswa, 
1. maybe could include something like checking if the MYCSD is more than a certain number, then only will be eligible for desasiwa. 

For the operator overloading,
1. Maybe can be used in the functions to calculate duration

For friend functions,
1. Maybe can make some print() functions or other functions to be friend functions (when the function have problems accessing the variables)
2. - Friend function in C++ is used when the class private data needs to be accessed directly without using object of that class. 
3. - Friend functions are also used to perform operator overloading
